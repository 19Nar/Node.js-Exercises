/*REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it represents a computer environment like a Windows console or Unix/Linux shell where a command is entered and the system responds with an output in an interactive mode. Node.js or Node comes bundled with a REPL environment. It performs the following tasks −

Read − Reads user's input, parses the input into JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.

Eval − Takes and evaluates the data structure.

Print − Prints the result.

Loop − Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl-c twice.

The REPL feature of Node is very useful in experimenting with Node.js codes and to debug JavaScript codes.*/
